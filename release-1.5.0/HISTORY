CHANGES between Dotlet 1.0 and Dotlet 1.5


FIXED:
- deprecated code removed (old functions call, like thread.stop())
- a bug fixed in the image scrolling


ADDED:
- a "print" button has been added (opening a print dialog), allowing the user to print 
the plot (as well as important informations) in a WYSIWYG way and to receive it 
as a pdf file.

The following functionalities, depending on mouse actions, only work with a 1:1 
zoom ratio

- when mouse-selecting+SHIF an area of the dotplot, Dotlet tries to find diagonals where at 
least half of the sequence is above the cutoff (as defined in the histogram). 
The diagonals must be fully contained in the selected area, and are drawn in red.
The result is displayed in a new window, and can be sent to the browser for 
further use.

- when mouse-moving+CTRL, a "magnetic cursor" helps the user to target high 
scores areas more precisely.

- when mouse-selecting+CTRL (on a sequence), Dotlet (starting from the selected 
point) extends the diagonal in both direction (as long as the scores are above 
the cutoff, as defined in the histogram). The result is displayed in a new window, 
and can be sent to the browser for further use.
