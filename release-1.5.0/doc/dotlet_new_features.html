		<h2>New features of Dotlet 1.5</h2>
		4 new features were implemented in Dotlet version 1.5.
		<ul>
			<li>
				A "print" button (opening a print dialog) has been added, allowing the user to print 
				the plot (as well as important informations) in a WYSIWYG way and to receive it as a pdf file.
				<br><br>
				<center>
					<table>
						<caption>
							<strong>Figure 1</strong>: print dialog showing available options
						</caption>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<img src="new_print.gif">
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>
				<br><br>
			</li>
			<li>
				When mouse-selecting+SHIFT an area of the dotplot, Dotlet tries to find diagonals where at least half 
				of the sequence is above the cutoff (as defined in the histogram). <b>The diagonals 
				must be fully contained in the selected area</b>, and are drawn in red (the whole diagonals are 
				considered, not the sole parts that are above cutoff). The result 
				is displayed in a new window, and can be sent to the browser for further use. <b>That functionality
				only works with a zoom ratio of 1:1.</b>
				<br><br>
				<center>
					<table>
						<caption>
							<strong>Figure 2</strong>: mouse selection (left), with 2 diagonals found (right)
						</caption>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<img src="new_selection.gif">
							</td>
							<td>
								<img src="new_selection2.gif">
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>
				<br><br>
			</li>
			<li>
				When mouse-moving+CTRL in the dotplot, a "magnetic cursor" helps the user to target high scores areas more precisely. 
				<b>That functionality only works with a zoom ratio of 1:1.</b>
				<br><br>
				<center>
					<table>
						<caption>
							<strong>Figure 3</strong>: magnetic cursor
						</caption>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<img src="new_magnetic.gif">
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>
				<br><br>	
			</li>
			<li>
				When mouse-selecting+CTRL on a diagonal in the dotplot, Dotlet (starting from the selected point) 
				extends the diagonal in both directions (as long as the scores are above the cutoff, 
				as defined in the histogram). The result is displayed in a new window, and can be 
				sent to the browser for further use. By combining several clicks on different locations, one can
				reconstruct a sequence. <b>That functionality only works with a zoom ratio of 1:1.</b>
				<br>
				<b>Warning : sequence reconstruction is done in the same order as the clicks on the dotplot. 
				Be careful to start from left to right and top to bottom, otherwise this might lead to complete 
				synthetic sequences.</b>
				<br><br>
				<center>
					<table>
						<caption>
							<strong>Figure 4</strong>: sequence reconstruction on the dotplot (left) and the result (right) 
						</caption>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<img src="new_reconstruction.gif">
							</td>
							<td>
								<img src="new_reconstruction_output.gif">
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</center>
				<br><br>
			</li>
		</ul>
