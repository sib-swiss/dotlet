This is the repository for the Dotlet sources, binaries, and documentation.

Please read the file COPYRIGHT.

To install:

Download, unzip and untar the archive file `dotlet-*.tar.gz' in a
directory of your choice. The class files are packed into a .jar file,
`dotlet.jar'. If you wish to use Dotlet as a stand-alone application,
your Java virtual machine must be able to fine this file somehow.
Sometimes this is a matter of setting the CLASSPATH environment
variable, but your mileage may vary, and the best is to read your Java
environment's documentation. If you wish to use Dotlet as an applet,
the .jar file must reside somewhere in your Web server document
hierarchy. Also, the HTML documents that are to include Dotlet must
contain the appropriate <APPLET> or <OBJECT> tag.  See file Dotlet.html
for an example.

Included in the distribution are two Perl scripts, mat2java.pl and
cmp2java.pl, that convert symbol comparison tables in the .mat and .cmp
formats into Java code suitable for use with Dotlet.
