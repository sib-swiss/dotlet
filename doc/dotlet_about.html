		<h1 align=center>About Dotlet</h1>
		<p><tt>Dotlet</tt> was written by <a
		href="mailto:marco.pagni@sib.swiss">Marco Pagni</a> and
		<a href="mailto:Thomas.Junier@sib.swiss">Thomas
		Junier</a>, form the <a href="https://sib.swiss/">SIB Swiss
		Institute of Bioinformatics</a> in Ecublens,
		Switzerland.</p>
		<p>The reason why we wrote <tt>dotlet</tt>
		is that we needed a diagonal plot tool for the December
		1998 practical sessions in bioinformatics at the Institute
		of Biochemistry. Since we had decided to base all the
		practical sessions on the World-Wide Web, we needed a
		program that would run in a web browser. To our knowledge,
		there was none, so we wrote it.</p>
		<p>The <tt>Dotlet</tt> source code is available free of charge for
		academic users. The distribution is in
